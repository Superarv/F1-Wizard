# Project Overview

## This is our TSA entry for the 2022-2023 school year. It is a web-based student organization tool centered around efficency, accessability, and power. It has 4 main features: To-do List, Calendar, Spreadsheet, and Notepad.
## The backend language used was python, specifically the flask framework
## For front-end, the main languages are HTML, CSS, and JS script tags, JS frameworks are not utilized because there is no need for JS anywhere other than front-end

## As of right now, this folder has nothing. This is because Dhruvank will not finish the front-end prototype i assigned him a week ago. (istg front-end "programmers" are insane)
